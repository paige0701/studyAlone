# studyAlone

Long term project of studying fundamentals of computer science and few programming languages.

Since I studied Business Administration in university, I have always thought I lack fundamentals of computer science.
Things like What is a CPU, how does HTTP work ? What is a RAM? ETC. 
All the basics that is crucial for solving complex algorithms.

I'm going to start to scratch.

From fundamentals of computer science,
basic algorithms
computer structures, networks and how does internet work!
And finally PYTHON.

My goal is to study little by little everyday.
It is hard because I'm a full time programmer and I have sooooo much work ...
that usually I work over time. However I'm thinking to going to cafe at least 2 days a week
after work to study !
