#Practice python

Going to study python from today. I've been using typescript for past two years, but realised that I should find one other language for coding interviews and test.

I've thought about studying java, but I've chose Python because

1. One of my favourite language. I've studied it before, want to finish it
2. Easier to solve algorithm with
3. A lot of information online
